# TODO:

* Add a how-to for searching in specific columns.
* Put object counters (how many threads/handles/ports etc.) in the popup menu.
* Color-coding (highlighting) values by their magnitude (like Windows Task manager).
* Add nice graphs!
* Smooth row transitions. This is hard.

# Maybe also:
* Color-coding different processes by their type: app, service, 32-bit, zombie/stuck...
* Smooth transition during orientation change.
* Tap file to view. Useful for logs.
